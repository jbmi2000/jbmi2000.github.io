Rarely does one get the opportunity to explain why steps are taken to do certain things in their lives, so I am grateful for this chance to do so here.  On the other hand, it is a bit of a challenge to talk about oneself, but I will give it my best shot.  

**Harpo, how does this work?**

For as long as I can remember, I have been intrigued by how things work.  As a little boy, I used to get toys for Christmas in December, and they would be completely disassembed by February.  I would play with them and then take them apart to see how they worked.  Sometimes I would be able to put them back together again, but , much to my parents' dismay, most of what I received would turn into a pile of spare parts that I would always promise to put back together but never did.  

**Get it Together**

Let's fast-forward a few years to my early teens.  My *take-everything-apart* phase had evolved into a *put-things-together* period.  Here is where I became close friends with model car kit companies like Revell and AMT.  My room was littered with modeler's glue, paints and paint thinner, snap-tight plastics, carving knives and anything else you could image would be needed to assemble these little masterpieces.  I still have a few of them 40 years later. (yikes!)

**Time to Get Serious**

During my college years, I was drawn toward electronics which turned into circuits and such.  Instead of choosing computer science, I chose technology, which was more about formulas for calculating resistance, capacitance, voltage, and building/testing circuitry.  So I was able to answer the question "What happens when you turn on a light switch?"  Sadly that's where my training ended.  

**"To Serve Man" - Wait!  It's a cook book!!!**

My professional career has been all about what happens when those circuits are put together to form a computer that takes in data, manipulates it, produces an output, and then helping people to understand how to work around situations when their computer's output is not what was desired.  Insert deep breath here.  (I know, it's a run-on sentence.  Just go with it please.)   It has been an interesting journey, as it has taught me the intricacies of personal interaction.  People tend to be the most cranky when they are hungry, sick, or when their computer is not working.  I have been that person on the other end of the phone line that soothes the "savage beast" with phrases of reassurance and understanding, even if I had no idea how to resolve their issues.  I have managed teams, and been on teams managed by others.  I have become adept at helping others with systems but there was still something missing.

***"Get back to where you once belonged"***

How does it work?  Yes, that question that I had been asking myself for years in the past, reared its ugly head again.  How does it work?  What makes software do what it does?  Who writes those error messages that few people understand?  How does it feel to be a part of creating something new and watching others benefit from it?  Can't honestly say that I pondered making the world a better place but it certainly is a respectable goal and a great benefit to pass on.  

**And with that...**

So that's why I decided to give up eating meat.  Oh wait, wrong blog.  Thank you for reading, if you made it this far...ha!  It took all of this just to say that I really want to know how software works.  With any luck, I will also be able to show my children that, when you have a goal, and stick with it, you can achieve great things.  Am I reaching for the stars?  Sure!  Aren't we all?
